          <p>So a free responce is an essay based on a certain topic that you just write. It's purpose is to just make you explore your thoughts.
          It won't be marked, there is no right or wrong answer. You just write continuosly for 10 minutes. So when you have written your free responce send it to my whatsapp, so that I can read it.</p>
